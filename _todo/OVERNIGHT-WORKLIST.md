# Overnight worklist — opened 2026-10-10 01:05 PDT

Ty, 2026-10-10 01:00: *"i want you to watch everything and make sure everything gets finished …
keep everything going until it's done … if it can be done without me, do it. work throughout the
night and finish as much as we can, make sure you don't get stopped yourself."*

This file is the queue the **`overnight-driver`** cron reads on every fire. It is the single source
of truth for what is left. NIGHT-WORKLIST.md is the previous night's list (items 0–6, all closed or
parked as Ty's call); do not rework those.

## The rules (not optional — each one earned by a real failure)

1. **One item, end to end.** Finish and verify before starting another. Ty's standing instruction.
2. **Run `bash scripts/ci.sh` before pushing**, not just `verify.py` — five checks live only in ci.sh.
3. **Verify the COMMIT, not the working tree.** `rm -rf /tmp/cicheck && mkdir -p /tmp/cicheck && git archive HEAD | tar -x -C /tmp/cicheck && cd /tmp/cicheck && python3 scripts/verify.py`. The tree can hold another session's uncommitted work; the runner cannot.
4. **Stage explicit paths. NEVER `git commit -a`.** A parallel session shares this tree.
5. **Never invent a fact, number or interval.** Name the gap instead of filling it.
6. **A content change voids a verification.** `verify.py` says so — get a fresh-context review.
7. **Never pipe a command whose exit status you rely on through `tail`** — `cmd > /tmp/out 2>&1; echo "EXIT=$?"`.
8. **If the tree holds uncommitted changes you did not make, leave them alone.** Read `git status` FIRST, and identify the owner from `_todo/` before touching a shared file.

## Who else is writing this tree right now (2026-10-10 01:05)

- **Safety/liability pass** — a live session is committing `about.html`, `guides/rv-air-conditioner-not-cooling.html`, and writing `_todo/SAFETY-ISSUES.md`. Items C1/C2 and section A/B are theirs. **Do not touch those files.**
- **New-owner guide** — a live session owns `guides/rv-new-owner-guide.html` and its sources.
- **Bridge fleet** — a live session owns `/home/user/claude-bridge`. Do not deploy userscript builds; see BRIDGE below.
- **You (driver)** — take items from the queue below that no one owns.

If somebody's uncommitted work is in your way: pick a different item. Do not merge, revert, or "finish" it for them.

## THE QUEUE (highest value first)

> **OWNERSHIP — W1–W5 are assigned to the rv-platform session `conv-ddc178a5`, authorised to
> proceed at 01:05 PDT on Ty's standing instruction.** That session is working them one at a time.
> **Driver: do NOT start W1–W5 while that session is active.** Check for an active turn
> (`letta messages status --conversation conv-ddc178a5-4f02-4490-90e9-bcaf9ae30739`) and look for
> its DONE tick here. Only take one of these if that session has been quiet for 2+ hours with the
> item still unticked. Work W6/W7 or the BRIDGE section instead.

### W1. Manuals-hub search workstream — OWNED by conv-ddc178a5
`manuals/` — the hub search. Read `_todo/SITE-TODO.md` §manuals for the specification before starting.

### W2. Directory pages — 201 inline `style=` attributes
The 51 `directory/<state>.html` pages carry 201 inline styles. Move them into the stylesheet classes. Mechanical, but touches 51 generated pages → **the regenerated pages ship in the SAME commit** (see `build-listings.py`). Verify with `build-listings.py --check`.

### W3. The black-tank-clogged page
A guide page is owed on a clogged black tank. Check `_todo/SITE-TODO.md` and `_data/guides.json` for the spec/slug before writing; run `scripts/new-guide.py` (and check its output against a page it did NOT write — the generator has known structural blind spots).

### W4. The two unopened Lippert documents
Two Lippert documents were identified but never opened/read. Find them in `_todo/SOURCING-FINDINGS-2026-10-09.md` and `research/`, fetch, read, and either act on the finding or record that the document does not support it.

### W5. Parts beyond the index
`/parts/` — the hub index exists; the entries beyond it are owed. See `_todo/PARTS-AND-BUSINESS-PLAN.md` and `_todo/PARTS.md`. **Do not change the centred layout** — it is Ty's own dated instruction (see CSS comment on `.part`).

### W6. Guide reviews not yet completed
The native-English pass covered the six 2026-10-08 guides. Anything since (and any guide whose content changed) needs a pass by a model strictly stronger than the drafter. Use the bridge lanes (deepseek / chatgpt / qwen are the reliable ones) or a fresh-context subagent. Verify the reply is a *completed review*, not one of the failure shapes in [[skills/claude-bridge/SKILL.md]].

### W7. Safety pass — SUPPORT ONLY
`_todo/SAFETY-ISSUES.md` is live and a session owns it. Do not take its pages. If its session goes quiet for more than ~2 hours with items still open, the sentinel will say so; only then pick up section C (wording fixes) which is low-risk.

---

## BRIDGE — do not duplicate

A live session owns `/home/user/claude-bridge`. As of 01:05: all six lanes healthy on v0.7.41, queue idle, `v0.7.42` staged in `outbox/` awaiting a paste into the **aistudio** lane by Ty (its own session knows the deploy path). **Work the bridge ONLY if:** the queue has jobs with no matching reply (spent jobs blocking a lane), or a heartbeat is stale. Sweep spent jobs with `tools/sweep-spent-jobs.py`. Do not deploy a userscript build yourself.

## MYSELF (last)

Anything learned tonight that would change tomorrow's behaviour belongs in a memory block or
reference file — not in this list. Memory upkeep during other work goes through the `memory`
subagent; when memory IS the task, edit it directly and commit.

---

## How to tick an item

When an item is finished: mark it here as DONE with the commit hash and one line of evidence, then
move to the next. Keep this file committed (explicit path) so the next fire sees the real state.
